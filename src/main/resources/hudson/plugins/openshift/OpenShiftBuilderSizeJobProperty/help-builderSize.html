	<p><b>Important:</b> This setting only applies if you set the job <i>Label Expression</i> to match the <i>Project name</i> of your job.</p>
	<p>
	Setting the job label is done automatically for you by the OpenShift client tools, but if you are manually setting
	up a job, you need to set this.  You can set the <i>Label Expression</i> by checking <i>Restrict where this project can be run</i>
	and then copying your <i>Project name</i> into the text field.  The label is used to lookup the job details, including 
	the <i>Builder Type</i> and <i>Builder Size</i> when your slave builders are created.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The builder size specifies the resources needed for your OpenShift build environment.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The resources available in the builder types are as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>Small: 512M storage, 250 procs, 300M ram, 100M swap.</li>
			<li>Medium: 750M storage, 2100 processes, 512M ram, 100M swap</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
